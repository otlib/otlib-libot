Issue: SCRO_IND0_DIVERGE                        -*- text -*-

* Synopsis:

Market rate trend calculation diverges between calculations produced
with calcTrends in SCR0 and calcTrends() in IND0. The mechanical logic
implemeted of the two functions is not different, at this time.

The divergence is illustrated in the file GBPUSDiM1.png

* Proposed Resolution:

Observe whether the same market rate data is being provided to an
MQL4 Script type program - there, in the respective Open, High, Low,
Close,  and Time buffers in the global namespace of the Script type
program - whether it may be the same data as is provided to an MQL4
Indicator type program, there in the time, open, high, low, and close
parameters to `OnCalculate`.
