    <title>Description</title>

    <para>The ATDM strategy proposes a principally event-oriented
    analysis of trends in the OsMA and MACD indicators, for
    orchestration of <emphasis>order open</emphasis> and
    <emphasis>order close</emphasis> events. Furthermore,
    an orchestration logic is developed, in the strategy, for purpose
    of limiting risk on event of <emphasis>order open</emphasis> or
    <emphasis>order close</emphasis>.</para> 

    <sidebar>
      <remark>Both of the _OsMA_ and _MACD_ indicators derive their
      respective rate values from <glossterm>moving average</glossterm>
      calculations.</remark>

          <para>
            After event of <emphasis>Open Order</emphasis>, conduct
            analysis of the MACD indicator's primary rate line. In an
            ideal market environment, the open order would be held

            market environment, a strong convergence of the two
            indicator lines - following a MACD crossover - may signal an
            ideal situation for closing any open order.

      <para>
        This strategy is made more complicated in some events,
        such as:
        <simplelist>
          <member>MACD Min/Max trend without MACD Crossover</member>
          <member>DOsMA rate lines illustrating multiple crossovers
          within a short duration</member>
        </simplelist>
      </para>

      <para>
        When there is a substantial duration beween the respective
        DoSMA and MACD crossover events, or &mdash; failing MACD
        crossover &mdash; beween the respective DOsMA Min/Max events,
        and when this is in corresponding with a substantial and
        favorable progress in market rate across the duration, then
        this strategy may  result in an appreciable return on
        investment.

            If applying a calculation based on

    <title>Case Studies</title>

    <remark>developed primarily in reference to EURUSD and USDCHF
    currency pairs - may not be advisable for trading onto JPY currency
    pairs</remark>

    <remark>The development of this strategy was begun in reference to
    a duration of relatively <emphasis>volatile</emphasis> and
    <emphasis>consistent</emphasis> trends on EURUSD. Some of the
    indicator signals applied in this strategy may not be productive
    to a strong sense of confidence for trading onto an inactive of
    ambiguous/wild market.</remark>
